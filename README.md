# Week14-CitiBikeSharing

NYC Citibike Analysis and Visualization study

The purpose of this analysis is to see if the NYC CitiBike program of bike sharing could be used as a model in determination of a similar program in Des Moines, Iowa. In order to prepare for this analysis, the data that was used within Module 14 for the August 2019 NYC Citibike study was cleansed and then visualized in Tableau. Parameters studied for the new data were based on duration of rides, breakdowns by gender and UserTypes, times when rides took place, and data needed to plan bike maintenance operations. 

Revenue producing users are classified as either “Customers” or “Subscribers”.  Customers are those who are short term riders while Subscribers have set up  annualized contracts for ride sharing services with reduced per-ride rates as opposed to customer rates. 

Takeaways from analysis: 

1.	Checkout Duration: An analysis shows that the majority of duration for bike rides were around 5 minutes for all riders

2.	Checkout Times by Gender: An additional breakdown by gender shows that males by far take the most 
rides as compared to females (or cyclists not categorized)

3.	Trip Times/Gender: As discussed previously, male riders dominate the majority of the rides. The following 2 “heat map” visualizations show that the majority of rides take place during the 8-9 am and 4-6 pm time frames. (the darker the frame, the greater the number of rides that take place) 

In terms of days of the week, the majority of the rides took place on Monday-Tuesday and Thursday Friday time frames.

4.	Trips made by User Type by Weekday: The following heatmap displays that the greatest number of rides were taken by male subscribers during the Monday-Wednesday and Thursday-Friday time frames.

5.	August Peak Hours by User Type: In terms of User Types, the additional following visualization shows that the number of rides were dominated by subscribers at the 8-9 am and 4-6 pm time frames.

 6.	Bike Utilization/Start and Stop Times: The next 2 visualizations demonstrate the utilization of the fleet of bikes employed. 

On the Bike Utilization chart, by clicking on each individual blue box, a pop-up box appears which details the BikeID and number of trips that bike has taken (Count of tripduration). By going in a top to bottom, left to right fashion, the bikes with the most amount of rides will be displayed in a decreasing manner.

On the Start and Stop Times chart, the heat map displays the number of bike start times; once again the darkest areas on the chart are those in the 8-9 am and 4-6 pm time frames.

These visualizations are important as those bikes with the greatest number of past trips should be scheduled for possible bike maintenance at those times when not in use. This might be during the 12 am-5 am time frame.

Visualizations Summary:  The major points to consider after use of the  Citibike data and visualizations were: 

1.	The majority of the users were male subscribers during the hours of 7-9 am and 4-6 pm. This would suggest that these rides are being used as an alternative for users going to and returning from their work
2.	The ride durations were short, most of which were 10 minutes or less
3.	Maintenance operations must be considered during the times when the bikes were not heavily used. (12 -5 am)

Prospective Des Moines Proposal

1.While this Citibike study should be seen as an initial effort, many other factors must be determined before a similar program should be considered in Des Moines such as: 
		a. Ages and genders of prospective riders taken from local census data
	  b. Prospective starting and ending points for the bike program. Thus,  longitude and latitude	.   data would need to be employed.
    c. What would be the make-up of the prospective riders?  Would there be students or visitors who might be potential customers/subscribers in such an effort?
